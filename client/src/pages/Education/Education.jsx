            <h2>Vedic Period</h2>
            <p>
              The origins of Ayurveda can be traced back to the Vedic period,
              during which the earliest sacred texts of India, known as the
              Vedas, were composed. Within the Vedas, particularly in the
              Atharvaveda, one finds hymns and verses related to medicinal
              plants, diseases, and healing practices.

            <h2>Compilation of Ayurvedic Texts</h2>
            <p>
              The foundational texts of Ayurveda, known as the "Charaka Samhita"
              and the "Sushruta Samhita," were written during this period.
              Charaka Samhita, attributed to the sage Charaka, focuses on
              internal medicine, while Sushruta Samhita, attributed to the sage
              Sushruta, primarily deals with surgery and surgical techniques.
